Braille is a specialized writing system for visually impaired people, where raised dots on embossed paper are used as tactile alphabet. The tool Bengali Braille to Text Translator will take in scanned image of Bengali Braille writing, apply pattern recognition, and translate it to text. The user does not need much theoretical or technical skill to run this software.
